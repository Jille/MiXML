MiXML is a tool to automate disk-jockeying.

You will have to describe a transition between two songs in XML. MiXML will then first play the first song and "mixes" it according to your script to the next song.

If this works we will extend it with:

* Recording scripts with USB DJ-controllers
* Implement this in an existing music player (Like [herrie](http://www.herrie.info/) or [Marietje](https://github.com/bwesterb/marietje))
